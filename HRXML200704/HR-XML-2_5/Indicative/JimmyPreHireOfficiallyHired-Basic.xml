	Scenario: JimmyPrehire's information was sent to a third party PRIOR to him
			  actually becoming an employee (that is, prior to him actually being hired).
			  See JimmyPreHireDetailed.xml for the document sent prior to this document
			  
			  Jimmy now officially becomes an employee and the actual HireInfo now needs to be sent.
			  In this example, Jimmy actually started on the 2004-10-05, as opposed to the intended
			  start date of 2004-10-01.  Since detailed information was already sent, the previously
			  sent information does not have to be sent again.  If previously sent information was
			  incorrect, then the correct information could be sent in this document or subsequent documents.
