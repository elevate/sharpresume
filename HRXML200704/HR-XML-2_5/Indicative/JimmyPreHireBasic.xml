<!-- Many times the intention of hiring an employee needs to be sent to
     a third party.  The person is technically not an employee, but information
     needs to be sent ahead of time.  Typically, this is so that the third party
     can meet contractual obligations (e.g. allow the employee to do online benefit
     enrollment on their first day of work.
     
     The <ProposedHireInfo> element is used to indicate when they are expected to
     become an employee.  Notice that the <IsEmployed> status is set to false, as
     the potential employee has not yet been 'hired'.


	Scenario: This XML document represents a bare boned information exchange.  Merely just
	reflecting the intention to have the person become an employee.  See example
	JimmyPreHireDetailed.xml for a document where the employee details are sent along
	with the propsed information (i.e. need information in advance to do eligibility calculations).
	
	WARNING:  EmploymentInfo/HireInfo should not be sent as they have not been hired!  That is the
	          purpose of the <ProposedHireInfo> node - to model the intention of becoming an employee
	          without stating that they actually have!  HireInfo would typically be sent when they
	          have actually become and employee.
