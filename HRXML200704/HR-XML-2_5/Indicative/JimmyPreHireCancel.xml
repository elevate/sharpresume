<!-- Many times the intention of hiring an employee needs to be sent to a third party.  
     The person is technically not an employee, but information needs to be sent ahead of time.  
     Typically, this is so that the third party can meet contractual obligations 
     (e.g. allow the employee to do online benefit enrollment on their first day of work.)

	 Scenario: Information about the proposed employee (Jimmy) was sent in a previous transction. 
     Jimmy has since declined the offer. This exchange is used to communicate that Jimmy has changed his 
     mind and will not become an employee. So the new hire process must be cancelled.     
     In this case the <ProposedHireInfo> element is used to indicate Jimmy has decided not to accept employment.
