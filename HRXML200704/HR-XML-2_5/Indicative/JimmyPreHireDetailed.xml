<!-- Many times the intention of hiring an employee needs to be sent to
     a third party.  The person is technically not an employee, but information
     needs to be sent ahead of time.  Typically, this is so that the third party
     can meet contractual obligations (e.g. allow the employee to do online benefit
     enrollment on their first day of work.
     
     The <ProposedHireInfo> element is used to indicate when they are expected to
     become an employee.  Notice that the <EmploymentStatus> is 'Not Employe', as
     the potential employee has still not be 'hired' yet - that is is not yet and employee.


	Scenario: This XML document represents a more detailed  information exchange.  Additional 
			  information had to be sent (e.g. to allow eligibility calculations).  This
			  information, when coupled with a <ProposedHireInfo> node, represents what is 
			  believed to reflect the reality of their employee & employment information when
			  they actually become an employee.  
	
	WARNING:  EmploymentInfo/HireInfo should not be sent as they have not been hired!  That is the
	          purpose of the <ProposedHireInfo> node - to model the intention of becoming an employee
	          without stating that they actually have!  HireInfo would typically be sent when they
	          have actually become and employee.
