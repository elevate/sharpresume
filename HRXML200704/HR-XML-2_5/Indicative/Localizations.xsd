This schema serves two functions.  First, it is a "hook" to connect the main, international schema(s) to all localized content including region specific components.  Second, if there are localizations that are universal (meaning that a concept is used everywhere, but used differently everywhere) then those common definitions can be used here, with region specific material included as an xsd:include.
