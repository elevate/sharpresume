Open Applications Group
Interface Specification XMLSchemas and Sample XML Files

OAGIS Release 8.0

April 05, 2002


These XML reference files continue to evolve.  Please feel
free to use them, but check www.openapplications.org for the most 
recent updates.

OAGIS 8.0 contains XML Schema, constraint XSL, and example XML documents. In
order to view XML SChema it is recommended that you make use of an XML IDE, as
the complete structure of the Business Object Documents are not viewable from
a single file.

Note that the sample files were used to verify the XMLSchema development, and 
do not necessarily reflect actual business transactions.  In many cases, 
the data fields in the XML files are just placeholder text.  Real-world
examples for each transaction will be provided as they become available.


Please send suggestions or bug reports to xml@openapplications.org

Thank you for your interest and support.
