The Party type carries with it all of the identifying and descriptive information about the party. 

A specific Party's role name is captured in the corresponding element's name, following the so-called "semantically-named element substitution group" design pattern. The instance is named [rolename]Party, as in SupplierParty, CustomerParty, etc. Each is of type Party, or of some derived type.

Need to bring more Party elements into PartyBase, once reg testing can be broken for a little while. mdf</p>
