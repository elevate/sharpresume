The GET may be paired with most of the nouns defined in the OAGIS specification.The response to this request is the SHOW verb.  The behavior of a BOD with a GET verb is quite predictable across most of the nouns it may be paired with.The GET is designed to retrieve a single piece of information by using that information's primary retrieval field, or key field.  The GET verb is not used to request several documents at once.  The GETLIST verb is designed to achieve that purpose and will be covered in more detail later.Selection Criteria:There are two types of selection capabilities for most BOD's that use the GET verb.1)  The first selection capability is called Field-Based Selection.  Within a GET-based Business Object Document, the first Data Type that occurs in a specific BOD structure is commonly used to provide the Field-Based Selection criteria.  This is always defined within the specific BOD and is commonly the required fields for that specific Data type.The Field-Based Selection enables the requester to provide a value or values (in the case of multiple required Field Identifiers), in the required fields.  Then the responding component uses those values to find and return the requested information to the originating business software component.2)  The second type of selection capability for GET-based BODs is called Data Type Selection.  Data Type selection enables the requester to identify which Data Types within the noun are requested to be returned in the response.  The use of this capability is described for each corresponding Data Type for all BODs that use the GET verb.  The Data Types are identified for retrieval within the GET instance of a BOD by including the name of the Data Type in the meta data but without any Field Identifiers or Segments identified within the Data Type. This will signify to the responding application that all of the data that corresponds to that Data Type is to be included in the response.If the Data Type is not requested, the Data Type identifier is not included in the GET request and this will signify to the responding component that the Data Type is not to be returned.</p>

               <p style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3">The purpose of the GetList verb is to enable a business software component to request summary information for one or more occurrences of a specific noun from another business software component.

The GetList may be paired with most of the nouns in the OAGIS specification.The response to this request is a BOD using the List verb. The GetList is designed to retrieve multiple occurrences of data such as all of the sales orders or all of the purchase orders within a requested range.  It does not require an exact match of the key fields in order to retrieve information.  It may use a range selection criteria with a "from" and "to" selection capability.  This behavior is quite different from the Get verb, which is designed to retrieve a specific noun using a specific key field.The GetList verb also enables the retrieval of information across several documents by using selection fields.  An example of this could be requesting all sales order lines for a specific item.  This type of functionality is limited to the capabilities of the responding application and needs to be determined during the implementation project.   More details on this capability will be described below. 

GetList attributes:
o	maxitems attribute is a number that indicates the number of maximum items to be returned.
o	rssave attribute is a Boolean flag that indicates whether the result set should be saved on the sending system if maxitems is exceeded.
o	rsstart attribute is a number of the starting record for the next section of the result set. If it is omitted, it is to be assumed the first of the maxitems.
o	rsref attribute is a string that represents the implementation-specific result set identifier for subsequent requests.

Selection Criteria:
There are two types of selection capabilities enabled by the BODs that use the GetList verb.
1)  Field-Based Selection

Allows the requesting system to ask for information that matches the data provided. It also allows the requestor to indicate the information that to be returned by specifying the ReturnCriteria indicated on the GetList Verb.

2) Range Selection

Allows the requesting system to provide a range of values for known data. This is accomplished by providing two occurances of the Noun. The first occurance indicates the "From" the second occurance indicates the "To" occurance. Again the requestor can  indicate the information that to be returned by specifying the ReturnCriteria indicated on the GetList Verb.

This is entirely the decision of the receiving software component and is not forbidden.The behavior of the LIST verb is quite straight forward with a few exceptions.  The LIST response to any GETLIST request needs to read the request carefully to ensure the response is returning the requested Data Types. The LIST needs to ensure the response to the GETLIST does not exceed the maxItems value.The LIST needs to find the specific Field Identifiers that are used for the Field-Based Selection or Range-Based Selection and process them accordingly.

The attributes associated with the LIST BODs are as follows:
o	rsstart attribute is a number that idicates the starting record for the section of the resulting set returned in the list message. This value should always match the rsstart value in the originating GetList BOD.
o	rscount attribute is a number that indicates the number of records returned in the message. The subsequent request for additional records should have a rsstart value of rscount + 1.
o	rstotal attribute is a number that indicates the total number of records in the result set.
o	rscomplete attribute is a Boolean that indicates that the list provided exhaust the possible values.
o	rsref attribute is a string that represents the implementation-specific result set identifier for subsequent requests.

The Bill of Material structure is broken down into three classifications or ways to represent the Item.  An Item may be included by itself as in the first sub-grouping, or an Item may be represented as part of a set of options or as an option within a class of options.

An example of an option would be CD-ROM for a laptop computer.  Then each of the types of CD-ROM’s for the option would be a separate Item.

An example of an option class would be memory for a laptop.  The options could then be 128, 256, or 512 megabytes of RAM.  Each of these options would then have separate Item identifiers for memory modules that makes up the appropriate amount of memory.  For 256 megabytes of RAM, this could be two 128 megabyte memory modules or one 256 megabyte.</p>

This BOD will not create or update either buyer's or supplier's inventory records.   The receiver of the request is responsible to make effective use of this information.

The BOD can be used in the following ways: 
(1)  for a supplier of goods to request from the buyer, the consumptn status of goods
(2)  for a vendor to request from the retailer if retail sales of goods have been made; and 
(3)  for inventory systems to request consumptn status from plant data collection and warehouse management systems.

This is an outline of the business flow that this BOD supports:
(1)  Overall purchase, replenishment or vendor managed inventory agreement is in place and/or a Get Consumptn message is sent by the supplier.
(2)  Show Consumptn Message is returned the to supplier, distributor or third party logistics provider, that material has been consumed.  This is done in response to events such as these (and/or the Get message), depending on implementation context:
  ·  Material is replenished to line side at manufacturing facitliy.
  ·  Material is assembled into final product.

The GetCredit does not imply any update, it is only an inquiry function.  The ShowCredit discussed in the next chapter will be the response back to the order management application.

Discussed in a later chapter is the UpdateCredit.  The UpdateCredit may be used in both directions between the order management and the accounts receivable application.  Its purpose is to keep order, shipment and open item amounts current.  Finally, the ChangeCreditStatus is used to update the order management application with any changes in business status for a particular trading partner.

·  Manufacturer exchanging catalogs with distributors/ suppliers/e-marketplaces
·  Distributors/ Suppliers/ e-marketplaces exchanging catalogs with Buyers or other trading partners

It may also be necessary to support Component Supplier Management (CSM) scenarios.  In this scenario a company will provide a service of sourcing and codifying the products of many companies and publishing a consolidated catalog. 

The Catalog exchange scenario can be implemented either as a simple scenario using a single BOD, or in the case or large catalogs involving complex pricing scenarios or partner specific details, as multiple BODs.</p>

Cross-references may be to other item identifiers to the same form fit and function, as well as references to item identifiers of other items (form fit and function).  In this document item relationships is used to refer to where the "to item" identifier, identifies a different form, fit and function to the "from item" identifier.  It should be noted that the item identifier that is "Primary" in one system may be a secondary identifier in another system.
  
For example, in the Application Integration space, the manufacturing system may regard the "Item Number" as the primary identifier.  The Order Management System may regard the Catalog number as the primary identifier. A company that manufacture hand held multi-meters may identify a given item in manufacturing with a 12 digit numeric code, 5432 123 12345.  The marketing and sales department may refer to the same item by it’s catalog number of FL 30/4.

In the Business to Business case a supplier of hand held multi-meters may market their products through a catalog provider.  The supplier has an item identifier with a corresponding party specific cross reference to the catalog providers identifier for the same item.  The catalog provider has a item identifier for hand held multi-meters and a corresponding party specific cross reference to the suppliers item number.

This BOD may be necessary to address Manufacturers, Distributor Resellers business ordering scenarios in a Order Management to Manufacturing application integration scenario.  It may also be necessary to address Component Supplier Management scenarios.  

There are many possible business applications in several environments that may use this capability. For example, a PDM, MRP, Inventory, or Manufacturing business application could use this to communicate the requirement to synchronize an Item cross-reference.  Item cross-references may be specific to a given party.  Examples may include, (but are not limited to):
·	Customers
·	Suppliers
·	Manufacturers
·	Carriers
·	Standards Associations

Party specific cross-references include:
·	Customer Part Number
·	Supplier Part Number
·	Manufacturers Part Number

Cross-reference types may also be universal.  Universal item cross-reference types may include, (but are not limited to)
·	Universal Packaging Code (UPC)
·	European Article Number (EAN)
·	Harmonized Schedule B number
·	GTIN Number
·	ISBN Number for Books

The BOD may be used to relate item identifiers for item identifiers that identify different items (form fit and function).  The Relationship types may also be universal.  Universal item relationship types may include, (but are not limited to)
·	Accessories
·	Spares
·	Consumables

An example of this in a business to business context might be a customer letting a supplier know the valid substitutes that a supplier may supply to fulfill an order for a specific item number.  An example of this in a application integration context might be between a Product Data Management (PDM) system and an Order Management system for accessories that may be offered to a customer with the sales of a major item.  For example, if a designers of a video camera, have designed it to work with the following accessories;
·	tripod, 
·	extended life battery pack
·	external microphone
·	Head Cleaner

The video camera may be designed to have the following spares replaced by the consumer
·	Lens Cover
·	Strap
·	Handle

The video camera may need the following consumable items on a recurring basis
·	Video Cassettes
·	Batteries
·	Lens Cleaners
the relationship between these items and the video camera may need to  represented to the Customer in Web Based ordering or Customer Service Rep (CSR), in desk based order entry.</p>

This BOD does not usually cause updates to occur. There are several possible business applications in several environments that may use this capability. The description and the pictures below visualize the possible use of this BOD.

In certain application suites, purchase order and invoice matching functionality exists in the purchasing application, while in other suites this functionality exists in the accounts payable application.

The invoice matching process may include several document types, including the following:

Two way match - Purchase Order and the Invoice 

 Three way match - Purchase Order, Invoice, and the Receipt 

Four way match – Purchase Order, Invoice, Receipt, and Inspection results 

Note:  For the four way match, it is assumed that inspection results have been updated on the Purchase Order for visibility in matching.

When matching takes place in the purchasing application, the purchasing application may have to request the accounts payable application to provide the supplier invoice to which purchasing transactions (purchase orders, goods receiving notes and inspection tickets) are to be matched.  This is the generally the situation when the invoice is initially entered into the accounts payable application.

Note that in some situations, accounts payable will send invoices to the purchasing application unsolicited. In others, invoices are entered directly into the purchase order application or are created by the purchase order application when using evaluated receipt settlement (ERS) and in this instance, it is not necessary to perform the separate integration described in these chapters.

When matching takes place in the accounts payable application, the purchasing application must inform the accounts payable application of the purchasing transactions (purchase orders, goods receiving notes and inspection tickets) to which the invoice (in accounts payable) is to be matched. Alternatively, the accounts payable application can request the information.

The purpose of the GetMatchDocument is to enable both the accounts payable application and the purchasing application to request the transactions that are required to be matched.  In both cases, the receiving application will use the ShowMatchDocument to return the requested information.

This BOD may be necessary to address the Make to Order, Assemble to Order, or Mixed Mode business ordering scenarios in an Order Management to Manufacturing application integration scenario.

There are many possible business applications in several environments that may use this capability. For example, a Manufacturing, distributor or reseller business application could use this to communicate the price change or request a price list.

It may also be necessary to support Component Supplier Management (CSM) scenarios. In this scenario a company will provide a service of sourcing and codifying the products of many companies and publishing a consolidated catalog. A customer purchases the product from the Catalog provider.  They have the capability to do comparison shopping from the catalog. Supplier Certification may be provided by the Catalog provider.

This definition of price list is intended to support simple pricing scenario, especially pricing that may accompany a published price list.  It is not intended to support complex pricing environments that may be needed to support features such as;

·         Deals and Promotions

·         Coupons and Sales Incentives

·         Rebates and Accruals

This functionality will be addressed in a subsequent release.  It is a working assumption that the representation of complex qualifications, coupons and sales incentives are rarely communicated between systems.

               <p style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3">In certain application suites, purchase order / invoice matching functionality exists in the purchasing application, while in other suites this functionality exists in the accounts payable application.

The invoice matching process may include several document types, including the following:

Two way match - Purchase Order and the Invoice 

Three way match - Purchase Order, Invoice, and the Receipt 

Four way match - Purchase Order, Invoice, Receipt, and Inspection results 

For the four way match, it is assumed that inspection results have been updated on the Purchase Order for visibility in matching.

When matching takes place in the purchasing application, the accounts payable application may have to inform the purchasing application of the supplier invoice to which purchasing transactions (purchase orders, goods receiving notes and inspection tickets) are to be matched if the invoice is initially entered into the accounts payable application. Note that in some situations, invoices are entered directly into the purchase order application or are created by the purchase order application when using evaluated receipt settlement (ERS) and in this instance, it is not necessary to perform the separate integration described in these chapters.

When matching takes place in the accounts payable application, the purchasing application must inform the accounts payable application of the purchasing transactions (purchase orders, goods receiving notes and inspection tickets) to which the invoice (in accounts payable) is to be matched. 

These integration scenarios have been developed for document matching to occur at the line level within the PuchaseOrder document and the Invoice document.  This may be a one to one relationship, or it may be a many to one relationship from Invoice to PuchaseOrder or from the PuchaseOrder to the Invoice.  Charges not associated with a specific Invoice line match be matched individually.

The LoadMatchDocument is for use both by the accounts payable application and the purchasing application in exchanging the transactions that are required to be matched.

Discussed in a later chapter are the UpdateMatchDocument.  The purpose of UpdateMatchDocument is for the accounts payable application to send successful matching notification or a match fail.notification to a purchasing application. </p>

An approved invoice is also known as the voucher.  OAGIS will define the scenario of invoices that get matched within the accounts payable application in a separate Business Service Request later.

The LoadReceiveable may also update the General Ledger, depending on the specific architecture of the accounting application.

The scope of the LoadReceiveable is to create a BOD to recognize customer obligation (accounts receivable asset).  Specific transactions include:
1.	Sales Invoice
2.	Credit Memo
3.	Debit Memo
4.	Charge Back

The LoadReceiveable may also be used for transaction that do not originate from an order management application.

The following two models illustrate that the LoadReceiveable may, in some cases, be adequate to update the financial applications, i.e., Receivables and General Ledger, and in other cases, will also require the PostJournal Business Object Document (BOD) to assure the General Ledger account balances are updated.
</p>

Many applications in the enterprise environment create data that cause changes in the account balances of a 
general ledger application.  Some components that have activity which will be reflected in a general ledger 
application are:

1.	Benefits
2.	Costing
3.	Human Resources
4.	Inventory Control
5.	Manufacturing
6.	Payroll
7.	Production
8.	Treasury

By no means is this a complete list of all the components that create activity which generate a journal entry.

Many tasks that occur within the enterprise applications cause the creation of a General Ledger journal entry.  
Tasks relate directly to the Component.  For example, the adjustment of inventory value is a task that occurs within 
the Inventory Control Component.  Some of the tasks that would be catalysts for changes in a general ledger include:

1.	Receiving Inventory
2.	Issuing Inventory
3.	Transferring Inventory
4.	Adjusting Inventory Value
5.	Adjusting Inventory Count

This BOD will not create or update either buyer's or supplier's inventory records.   The receiver of the request is responsible to make effective use of this information.

The BOD can be used in the following ways: 
(1)  for a buyer of goods to inform the supplier that goods have been consumed, and replenishment will likely be required; 
(2)  for a retailer to inform the vendor that retail sales of goods have been made; and 
(3)  for plant data collection systems and warehouse management systems to inform inventory systems that goods have been consumed and inventory records should be adjusted accordingly.

This is an outline of the business flow that this BOD supports:
(1)  Overall purchase, replenishment or vendor managed inventory agreement is in place.
(2)  Message is sent to supplier, distributor or third party logistics provider, that material has been consumed.  This is done in response to events such as these, depending on implementation context:
  ·  Material is replenished to line side at manufacturing facitliy.
  ·  Material is assembled into final product.
  ·  Material is purchased and removed from facility by customer.
(3)  Supplier, distributor, third party logistics provider replenishes material, using information provided in the ShowConsumption message, the demand and shipment forecasts, and the terms of the overall purchase or vendor managed inventory agreement.</p>

Cross-references may be to other item identifiers to the same form fit and function, as well as references to item identifiers of other items (form fit and function).  In this document item relationships is used to refer to where the “to item” identifier, identifies a different form, fit and function to the “from item” identifier.  It should be noted that the item identifier that is “Primary” in one system may be a secondary identifier in another system.

For example, in the Application Integration space, the manufacturing system may regard the “item Number” as the primary identifier.  The Order Management System may regard the Catalog number as the primary identifier. A company that manufacture hand held multi-meters may identify a given item in manufacturing with a 12 digit numeric code, 5432 123 12345.  The marketing and sales department may refer to the same item by it’s catalog number of FL 30/4.

In the Business to Business case a supplier of hand held multi-meters may market their products through a catalog provider.  The supplier has an item identifier with a corresponding party specific cross reference to the catalog providers identifier for the same item.  The catalog provider has a item identifier for hand held multi-meters and a corresponding party specific cross reference to the suppliers item number.

This BOD may be necessary to address Manufacturers, Distributor Resellers business ordering scenarios in a Order Management to Manufacturing application integration scenario.  It may also be necessary to address Component Supplier Management scenarios.  

There are many possible business applications in several environments that may use this capability. For example, a PDM, MRP, Inventory, or Manufacturing business application could use this to communicate the requirement to synchronize an Item cross-reference.  Item cross references may be specific to a given party.  Examples may include, (but are not limited to):
·	Customers
·	Suppliers
·	Manufacturers
·	Carriers
·	Standards Associations

Party specific Cross References include:
·	Customer Part Number
·	Supplier Part Number
·	Manufacturers Part Number

Cross Reference types may also be universal.  Universal item cross reference types may include, (but are not limited to)
·	Universal Packaging Code (UPC)
·	European Article Number (EAN)
·	Harmonized Schedule B number
·	GTIN Number
·	ISBN Number for Books

The BOD may be used to relate item identifiers for item identifiers that identify different items (form fit and function).  The Relationship types may also be universal.  Universal item relationship types may include, (but are not limited to)
·	Accessories
·	Spares
·	Consumables

An example of this in a business to business context might be a customer letting a supplier know the valid substitutes that a supplier may supply to fulfill an order for a specific item number.  An example of this in a application integration context might be between a Product Data Management (PDM) system and an Order Management system for accessories that may be offered to a customer with the sales of a major item.  For example, if a designers of a video camera, have designed it to work with the following accessories;
·	tripod, 
·	extended life battery pack
·	external microphone
·	Head Cleaner

The video camera may be designed to have the following spares replaced by the consumer
·	Lens Cover
·	Strap
·	Handle

The video camera may need the following consumable items on a recurring basis
·	Video Cassettes
·	Batteries
·	Lens Cleaners
the relationship between these items and the video camera may need to  represented to the Customer in Web Based ordering or Customer Service Rep (CSR), in desk based order entry.</p>

               <p style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3">In certain application suites, purchase order / invoice matching functionality exists in the purchasing application, while in other suites this functionality exists in the accounts payable application.

The invoice matching process may include several document types, including the following:

Two way match - Purchase Order and the Invoice 

Three way match - Purchase Order, Invoice, and the Receipt 

Four way match - Purchase Order, Invoice, Receipt, and Inspection results 

For the four way match, it is assumed that inspection results have been updated on the Purchase Order for visibility in matching.

When matching takes place in the purchasing application, the accounts payable application may have to inform the purchasing application of the supplier invoice to which purchasing transactions (purchase orders, goods receiving notes and inspection tickets) are to be matched if the invoice is initially entered into the accounts payable application. Note that in some situations, invoices are entered directly into the purchase order application or are created by the purchase order application when using evaluated receipt settlement (ERS) and in this instance, it is not necessary to perform the separate integration described in these chapters.

When matching takes place in the accounts payable application, the purchasing application must inform the accounts payable application of the purchasing transactions (purchase orders, goods receiving notes and inspection tickets) to which the invoice (in accounts payable) is to be matched. 

These integration scenarios have been developed for document matching to occur at the line level within the PurchaseOrder document and the Invoice document.  This may be a one to one relationship, or it may be a many to one relationship from Invoice to PurchaseOrder or from the PurchaseOrder to the Invoice.  Charges not associated with a specific Invoice line match be matched individually.

The purpose of the ShowMatchDocument is to enable the accounts payable application and the purchasing application to exchange information required either by request or initiated by some business event.</p>

This BOD may be necessary to address the Make to Order, Assemble to Order, or Mixed Mode business ordering scenarios in a Order Management to Manufacturing application integration scenario.

There are many possible business applications in several environments that may use this capability. For example, a Manufacturing, distributor or reseller business application could use this to communicate the price change or request a price list.

It may also be necessary to support Component Supplier Management (CSM) scenarios.  In this scenario a company will provide a service of sourcing and codifying the products of many companies and publishing a consolidated catalog.  A customer purchases the product from the Catalog provider.  They have the capability to do comparison shopping from the catalog.  Supplier Certification may be provided by the Catalog provider.

This definition of price list is intended to support simple pricing scenario, especially pricing that may accompany a published price list.  It is not intended to support complex pricing environments that may be needed to support features such as;
·	Deals and Promotions
·	Coupons and Sales Incentives
·	Rebates and Accruals

This functionality will be addressed in a subsequent release.  It is a working assumption that the representation of complex qualifications, coupons and sales incentives are rarely communicated between systems.

               <p style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3">A Shipment is a business document that details the intent to transport a specific quantity of material goods from a supplier to a single customer business partner destination.  The Shipment has been modeled after similar proprietary documents on popular business software packages (SAP's Delivery Note, Oracle Applications' Delivery document, etc.)

A Shipment is typically derived from the shipping schedule associated with a customer's purchase or sales order, once overall demand and various other business factors which prioritize the availability of the supplier's goods inventory have been evaluated.

The Shipment document is designed to have a dynamic structure and content. Initial shipment planning information can be updated and significant detail (actual picked inventory attributes, ship unit packaging, etc.) may be added during the execution phase of the supplier's order fulfillment and shipping business processes.  

The final form of the Shipment document can provide detail about the carrier and level of service used to transport the material, the exact quantity and attributes of the material shipped, and how that material is physically packaged and identified for transport.   

To aid the customer's planning and receiving business processes, the supplier may transmit the final Shipment document to customer in advance so that they can prepare for carrier arrival and then efficiently accept and utilize the ordered material.  In this use case, the Shipment document may function as a traditional Advance Ship Notice (ASN).

A ShipUnit is a data element that identifies and describes a specific collection of goods inventory that is packaged by a supplier for carrier transportation to a customer business partner destination. 

A ShipUnit is generally the smallest "thing" that can be individually moved and tracked throughout a carrier's transportation network.  The physical size, inventory, content and internal nested container complexity within a ShipUnit is arbitrary.  The ShipUnit component was specifically designed to be transportation mode independent.  It may be used to represent any uniquely identifiable and trackable assembly, container or vessel including, but not limited to: a parcel express package; a pallet of identical or mixed items; a truck trailer, rail car or an ocean cargo container.

This BOD does not usually cause updates to occur.
Shipment Characteristics

A Shipment document does not necessarily have a one-to-one relationship with any customer purchase/sales order document, line item or line item schedule. For shipping efficiency, a Shipment document may consolidate inventory shipment requests from a variety of different orders that have the same ultimate physical destination.  In fact, there may be no customer sale at all, as when the supplier is simply transferring inventory from one warehouse site to another within their enterprise to maintain optimum stocking levels.  

A Shipment typically involves a minimum of three business partner entities: Supplier, Carrier, and Customer in the most common business transaction scenario.   However these partner titles are more useful as descriptions of the basic roles in the Shipment process.  The actual number and relationship of the potential business partners/parties involved in the transaction is intended to be flexible in usage to accommodate agents working on behalf of partners and unique or complex scenarios.

The ShipUnit component identify and describe the physical shipping container(s) and internal packaging structure of the delivered goods.  ShipUnit component are typically constructed to describe the result of an inventory picking and packing operation.

The ShipUnit structure complements the line-item oriented summary information provided in the Shipment's ShipItem and InventoryDetail component with detailed information to accurately describe complex shipping unit assemblies and item packaging.  This robust level of detail is often demanded by customers to improve the efficiency of their receiving operations.  If the supplier provides trustworthy ship unit packaging information in advance, the customer does not have to spend valuable receiving personnel time breaking down the containers to inspect and tally each inventory item.

The general industry trend toward smaller just-in-time deliveries of only the required amount of goods, customer-imposed packaging configurations and requirements, and suppliers performing value-added light assembly customization at the time of shipment is driving the need for more detailed information about the product as it is actually delivered.</p>

Cross-references may be to other item identifiers to the same form fit and function, as well as references to item identifiers of other items (form fit and function).  In this document item relationships is used to refer to where the “to item” identifier, identifies a different form, fit and function to the “from item” identifier.  It should be noted that the item identifier that is “Primary” in one system may be a secondary identifier in another system.

For example, in the Application Integration space, the manufacturing system may regard the “item Number” as the primary identifier.  The Order Management System may regard the Catalog number as the primary identifier. A company that manufacture hand held multi-meters may identify a given item in manufacturing with a 12 digit numeric code, 5432 123 12345.  The marketing and sales department may refer to the same item by it’s catalog number of FL 30/4.
In the Business to Business case a supplier of hand held multi-meters may market their products through a catalog provider. The supplier has an item identifier with a corresponding party specific cross reference to the catalog providers identifier for the same item.  The catalog provider has a item identifier for hand held multi-meters and a corresponding party specific cross reference to the suppliers item number.

This BOD may be necessary to address Manufacturers, Distributor Resellers business ordering scenarios in a Order Management to Manufacturing application integration scenario.  It may also be necessary to address Component Supplier Management scenarios.  

There are many possible business applications in several environments that may use this capability. For example, a PDM, MRP, Inventory, or Manufacturing business application could use this to communicate the requirement to synchronize an Item cross-reference.  Item cross-references may be specific to a given party.  Examples may include, (but are not limited to):
·	Customers
·	Suppliers
·	Manufacturers
·	Carriers
·	Standards Associations

Party specific Cross References include:
·	Customer Part Number
·	Supplier Part Number
·	Manufacturers Part Number

Cross-reference types may also be universal. Universal item cross-reference types may include, (but are not limited to)
·	Universal Packaging Code (UPC)
·	European Article Number (EAN)
·	Harmonized Schedule B number
·	GTIN Number
·	ISBN Number for Books

The BOD may be used to relate item identifiers for item identifiers that identify different items (form fit and function).  The Relationship types may also be universal.  Universal item relationship types may include, (but are not limited to)
·	Accessories
·	Spares
·	Consumables

An example of this in a business to business context might be a customer letting a supplier know the valid substitutes that a supplier may supply to fulfill an order for a specific item number.  An example of this in a application integration context might be between a Product Data Management (PDM) system and an Order Management system for accessories that may be offered to a customer with the sales of a major item.  For example, if a designers of a video camera, have designed it to work with the following accessories;
·	tripod, 
·	extended life battery pack
·	external microphone
·	Head Cleaner

The video camera may be designed to have the following spares replaced by the consumer
·	Lens Cover
·	Strap
·	Handle

The video camera may need the following consumable items on a recurring basis
·	Video Cassettes
·	Batteries
·	Lens Cleaners

The relationship between these items and the video camera may need to  represented to the Customer in Web Based ordering or Customer Service Rep (CSR), in desk based order entry.

This BOD may be necessary to address the Make to Order, Assemble to Order, or Mixed Mode business ordering scenarios in a Order Management to Manufacturing application integration scenario.

There are many possible business applications in several environments that may use this capability. For example, a Manufacturing, distributor or reseller business application could use this to communicate the price change or request a price list.

It may also be necessary to support Component Supplier Management (CSM) scenarios.  In this scenario a company will provide a service of sourcing and codifying the products of many companies and publishing a consolidated catalog.  A customer purchases the product from the Catalog provider.  They have the capability to do comparison shopping from the catalog.  Supplier Certification may be provided by the Catalog provider.

This definition of price list is intended to support simple pricing scenario, especially pricing that may accompany a published price list. It is not intended to support complex pricing environments that may be needed to support features such as;
·	Deals and Promotions
·	Coupons and Sales Incentives
·	Rebates and Accruals

This functionality will be addressed in a subsequent release. It is a working assumption that the representation of complex qualifications, coupons and sales incentives are rarely communicated between systems.

The invoice matching process may include several document types, including the following:

Two way match - Purchase Order and the Invoice 

Three way match - Purchase Order, Invoice, and the Receipt 

Four way match - Purchase Order, Invoice, Receipt, and Inspection results 

For the four way match, it is assumed that inspection results have been updated on the Purchase Order for visibility in matching.

When matching takes place in the purchasing application, the accounts payable application may have to inform the purchasing application of the supplier invoice to which purchasing transactions (purchase orders, goods receiving notes and inspection tickets) are to be matched if the invoice is initially entered into the accounts payable application. Note that in some situations, invoices are entered directly into the purchase order application or are created by the purchase order application when using evaluated receipt settlement (ERS) and in this instance, it is not necessary to perform the separate integration described in these chapters.

When matching takes place in the accounts payable application, the purchasing application must inform the accounts payable application of the purchasing transactions (purchase orders, goods receiving notes and inspection tickets) to which the invoice (in accounts payable) is to be matched. 

These integration scenarios have been developed for document matching to occur at the line level within the PuchaseOrder document and the Invoice document.  This may be a one to one relationship, or it may be a many to one relationship from Invoice to PuchaseOrder or from the PuchaseOrder to the Invoice.  Charges not associated with a specific Invoice line match be matched individually.

The LoadMatchDocument is for use both by the accounts payable application and the purchasing application in exchanging the transactions that are required to be matched.

The purpose of UpdateMatchDocument is for the accounts payable application to send successful matching notification or a match fail.notification to a purchasing application. </p>

               <p style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3">In certain application suites, purchase order / invoice matching functionality exists in the purchasing application, while in other suites this functionality exists in the accounts payable application.
The invoice matching process may include several document types, including the following:
·	Two way match - Purchase Order and the Invoice
·	Three way match - Purchase Order, Invoice, and the Receipt
·	Four way match – Purchase Order, Invoice, Receipt, and Inspection results

Note:  For the four way match, it is assumed that inspection results have been updated on the Purchase Order for visibility in matching.
When matching takes place in the purchasing application, the accounts payable application may have to inform the purchasing application of the supplier invoice to which purchasing transactions (purchase orders, goods receiving notes and inspection tickets) are to be matched if the invoice is initially entered into the accounts payable application. Note that in some situations, invoices are entered directly into the purchase order application or are created by the purchase order application when using evaluated receipt settlement (ERS) and in this instance, it is not necessary to perform the separate integration described in these chapters.

When matching takes place in the accounts payable application, the purchasing application must inform the accounts payable application of the purchasing transactions (purchase orders, goods receiving notes and inspection tickets) to which the invoice (in accounts payable) is to be matched.  
These integration scenarios have been developed for document matching to occur at the line level within the PO document and the Invoice document.  This may be a one to one relationship, or it may be a many to one relationship from Invoice to PO or from the PO to the Invoice.  Charges not associated with a specific Invoice line match be matched individually.
The purpose of the UpdateMatchFailure is to notify the purchasing application of a matching failure such as a tolerance failure. The UpdateMatchOk is used for the accounts payable application to send successful matching notification to a purchasing application.  

The LoadMatchDocument is discussed in another chapter.  The LoadMatchDocument is used to keep invoice, purchase order, goods receipt note and inspection ticket information current. 

In the model below, invoice matching functionality exists in the accounts payable application, the invoice is entered into accounts payable, and purchasing publishes matching document information to which accounts payable subscribes.

               <p style="margin-top: 3; margin-bottom: 3">The purpose of the UpdateProductRequirement is to enable a business application such as Order Management to reserve a quantity of goods or services for a specific date and time. The business process scenario is the Order Management application interacting with the Available to Promise or Production application in order to determine availability of a product for the customer.

This scenario is commonly referred to as Make to Order or Build to Order.
The UpdateProductRequirement accomplishes this task in a two step process within this one request:
1.  First the receiving business application checks to see if an item is available in sufficient quantity by a specific date and time.
2.  The receiving business application then reserves that quantity of inventory for that specific date and time combination if the product is available.
If the product requested is not available, 

The responding application may send one of two responses:
1.  A ConfirmBOD to confirm the denial of the request.
2.  A ShowProductAvailability  to communicate an alternative product availability.  This may be OrderItem, Date, or Quantity, or a combination of these.  This may also be accompanied with a message in the Note field Identifier stating that this is an alternative.

If the product requested is available:
The responding application may send a ConfirmBOD to confirm the execution of the request.

This BOD will likely cause updates to occur.

This BOD may be used individually, or as part of a larger interface scenario.  The GetProductAvailability and ShowProductAvailability may be used before an UpdateProductRequirement, but they are not required. </p>
